# Given a binary visible vector:
# 1) Determine probabilities that hidden units are on
# 1a) Need the weight matrices. Absorb the biases into the weight matrix. Will need to sit down and spec out the matricies to make sure everything is set up correctly.
# 2) Do thresholding of hidden units based on thresholding of a uniform random number
